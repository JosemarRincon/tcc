dos palos no teste palográfico\textgreater}
Analysis of the palographic test is typically done manually by the psychologist, requiring the counting of each Palo or vertical line, that a person can express on a sheet of paper. The test can be applied individually or in groups, the counting process being exhaustive, time consuming and subject to human error. Aiming to automate this process, a solution was proposed using computer vision technique, based on Python Opencv library, enabling you to perform preprocessing, segmentation, representation and recognition, applied to images captured by smartphone in an environment with homogeneous lighting. The results allowed us to identify each trace and count them in an orderly manner by time intervals,, suggesting a promising scenario for the quantitative analysis of the palographic test automatically.
